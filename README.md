# GLCD Library for AVR Microcontrollers
*STILL WORKING ON IT*

## Overview

This project aims to create an AUTOSAR-inspired library for interfacing with a Graphic LCD (GLCD) of size 128x64 pixels on AVR microcontrollers. The library follows standard conventions, providing a modular and configurable solution for integrating GLCD functionality into your AVR-based projects.

## Features

- Initialization and configuration of GLCD.
- Writing commands and data to the GLCD.
- Reading data from the GLCD.
- Support for individual channel control and group operations.
- Adherence to AUTOSAR naming conventions and standards.
